# supercollider-complete-track

a complete house track in SuperCollider.
(only two and a half minutes long, so not _really_ complete,
but enough to get the idea.)

## from CCRMA 2018

I created this track at the SuperCollider workshop this past summer at [Stanford's CCRMA (Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics)](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/).
It was a great workshop and I highly recommend it.

## how it works

To play the beat, first run `ruby installer.rb`, then load `track.scd` in SuperCollider and evaluate the file.

## drum samples

Two drum samples come from freesound.org:

Thanks to their respective creators!
